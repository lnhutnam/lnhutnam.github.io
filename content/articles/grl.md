Many real world complex sytems such as social networks, biological networks, and information networks can be represented in form of graphs. One of the most difficult characteristic for modelling is sophisticated. Thus, one need to find effective graph data representation so can lead to some advanced for many downsteam tasks such as pattern discovery, analysis, and prediction.

In the era of big data, dealing with large graph is challenging. One need to tackle with several challenges to graph processing and analysis such as:
- High computational complexity
- Low parallelizability
- Inapplicability of machine learning methods.
