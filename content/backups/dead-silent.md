In this no-meaning world, there is no-meaning life. And the people who live in it have their own way of making it meaningful. I always think that "your life your choice", and so the way you go is different from the way I go. Everything seems to be distinguished, but "all roads lead to Rome". Because it doesn’t matter how something is done, but rather what the end result is. For any young boy like us, we always have our own dreams—to become richer with a lot of money or achieve a higher level in this hierarchical society, in our own religion, in our own country. And in general, we want one thing: to become better and better compared to yesterday. And when you achieve a higher position than others, are you looking down on them? Maybe yes and maybe no for specific cases.

For me, I always ask myself some shit question starting with "W": What's putting me in a lower position when compared to other friends or other people? Why do I fall into this situation? Am I weak? What should I do to get out of these states?. And you know, our life is like a function, sometimes it goes up and sometimes it goes down, and when it is going up it is certain that one day it will go down. In case you are on a promotion path, your function is probably a linear or exponential increasing function, then will you look down on those who are less talented? The answer is almost no, because why, it is because of pride or arrogance in yourself. This life is like a school class, but that doesn't mean that having a high rank in that school class means you can do anything. Agree that in that high position you can do whatever, think whatever you want, but for what purpose? what value here? what contribute?

I don't care about anything. Not caring here means I don't care what other people think of me. I look up to people who are better than me to have motivation to strive, and to people who are unlucky to feel like I've done well with my work. I always think that we just need to feel happy and comfortable with our own job, our own thing, and our own life. We must honour the principle of nature, respecting individual freedom, and one damping factor in everything in our life. And then, turn ourselves into basic, harmonious beings with this world to become only one abstract thing. In short, it is about getting rid of each person's own ego.
