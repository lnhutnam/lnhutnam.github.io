I currently studying graduated programme in **Computer Sciences** and **Applied Mathematics** (*two distinguished Master programmes*) at the University of Science, Vietnam National University, HCMC. In the Computer Science Graduate Program, I have the privilege of being mentored by **<a href="https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/~lhbac/">Prof. PhD. Le Hoai Bac</a>**. Prior to my graduate studies, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, with guidance from **<a href="https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/~lnthanh/">Mr. Le Ngoc Thanh</a>** on the topic of *knowledge graph completion based on neural networks*. 

My primary research focus is on **graph mining**, particularly in the area of knowledge graphs, including challenges related to completion and reasoning. In addition to this, I possess a deep interest in theoretical computer science—covering areas such as *graph theory* and *distributed theory*—as well as in mathematics, where my passions lie in *mathematical programming, numerical methods, and topics related to probability*.

## Blog content, and working

This blog is built with Hugo with Theme Tokiwa which is a minimalistic blog theme. The main color tone is Tokiwa-iro and the name of this theme. For personal purpose, the main colour has changed to nearly blue. This theme is built on the top of [Jim Frenette's](https://jimfrenette.com/2019/02/hugo-static-site-generator-blank-starter-theme/) [Hugo Starter Theme](https://github.com/jimfrenette/hugo-starter) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Inspired by [Tailwind Toolbox - Minimalist-Blog](https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/Minimalist-Blog) by [贺叶霜](https://github.com/heyeshuang)

In this blog, I maintain some kind of works on his research things, good news and bad news from my own life. Currently, I am writting/ maintancing:
- [Mathematics]({{< relref "mathematics" >}})
- [Research projects related to Graphs & its applications]({{< relref "n2l" >}})
- [Collection of favoriate quotes]({{< relref "quotations" >}})
- [Randomized photography]({{< relref "photography" >}})
- [Useful resource sharing]({{< relref "resources" >}})

Furthermore, I also maintance some Github Organization:
- [stmrdus](https://github.com/stmrdus), stand for Static-Temporal Multi-Relational Research: sharing about Reasoning on multi-relational data, Knowledge graph completion, Temporal knowledge graph reasoning and focasting, and related topic of reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimzation (Machine learning-based approach).
- [csc17103](https://github.com/csc17103), public and sharing resources of CSC17103 course at FIT-HCMUS, maintanced by Nam Le during time he worked as Visiting Lecturer here.
- [nlor3](https://github.com/nlor3), public and sharing resources about Operation Research, maintanced by Nam Le during time he studied at FIT-HCMUS.

    <font color = "7C4700">
        Knowledge graphs are organized as triplets to represent facts from the real world and play an important role in various intelligent information systems. 
        Because knowledge graphs are frequently constructed using manual or semi-automatic methods, they often miss connections between entities. 
        Link prediction was created to solve this problem. Many recent state-of-the-art studies, such as those introducing the RotatE and RotatHS models, 
        have advocated for rotation transformations with entity and relation embeddings in complex vector spaces. However, using only rotation planes means
        that these models do not have the expressive power of models based on neural networks, such as the ConvE and the ConvR models. As a result, link prediction
        performance suffers. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes the ConvRot model, which integrates a 2D convolution. Specifically, we perform
        convolution on embeddings of entities and relations to obtain support vector embeddings. These vectors are then integrated into an element-wise rotation
        from the head entity to the tail entity using the Hadamard product, enabling the model to capture local interactions among entities and relations through
        the neural network while still ensuring intuitiveness through a roto-transformation in the link prediction. In addition, we present two strategies for
        designing the complex convolution module and show their effects on model performance. The proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmark datasets
        and achieves significantly improved results on MRR and Hits@K (K = 1, 3, 10). Overall, our model’s link prediction performance is superior by approximately
        5–7 %. Moreover, the ConvRot model is also considered separately on many relation types, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. 
        Finally, we prove that type constraints can help increase the model’s overall performance, especially on complex and large datasets.
