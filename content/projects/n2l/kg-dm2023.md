Here are my reading collections from accepted at Data Mining Conferences about knowledge graphs and related topics. Almost all the papers I took were at the Github repository of [Naganandy](https://github.com/naganandy), and the readers can find them [here](https://github.com/naganandy/graph-based-deep-learning-literature/blob/master/conference-publications/folders/submissions_iclr/2024.md). My take notes were based on the categories as well as in this repo, which include:
- Multi-modality
- Data mining
- Knowledge and Reasoning
- Recommendation with Graph
- Knowledge graphs
- Miscellaneous (Beyond knowledge graphs)
